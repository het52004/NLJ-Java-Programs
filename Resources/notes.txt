1. Static methods can only access static members of a class.

2. Local variables, variables that are declared inside a method must be assigned of a value, else it gives error!

3. Global variables, variables that are declared in class and not in specific method, if not assigned value then by default 0 is stored.

4. Overriding with static keyword is nothing but function hiding. instance = overriding, static = hiding
