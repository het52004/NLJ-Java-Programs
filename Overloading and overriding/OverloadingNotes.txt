Method overloading, also known as compile time polymorphism! 

1. Methods having same names but different work is called method overloading.

2. Method overloading is an example of compile-time polymorphism, where the method to be called is resolved during compilation.

3. (i.)public void f1();
   (ii.)public void f1(int a);
   both above methods have same name but different parameters, when no arguments are passed during call then method (i.) is executed, if arguments are passed then method (ii.) is executed.

4. Return type of the method does not matter in method overloading, Overloading solely depends on the parameter list. You cannot overload methods by just changing the return type.

5. class A {
        public void overloadingInAClass(){
            System.out.println("Overloading in A class");
        }
        public void overloadingInAClass(int a){
            System.out.println("Overloading in A class with int parameter");
        }
    }
    class B extends A{
        
    }

    public class Overloading {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // A a = new A();
            // a.overloadingInAClass();
            // a.overloadingInAClass(1);

            // B b = new B();
            // b.overloadingInAClass();
            // b.overloadingInAClass(1);
        }
    }

    here if B inherits class A then B can also perform same as A, and overloading is done, program runs fine!
