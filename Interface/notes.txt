Imagine an electric socket in your house.

The socket (interface) allows different devices (AC, Fan, Charger) to plug in.

Devices implement their own functionality (AC cools, Fan rotates, Charger charges).

You don’t need a separate socket for each device → One socket (interface) works for all!

That’s what interfaces do in Java!


interface Payment {
    void pay();
}

class CreditCard implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paying with Credit Card...");
    }

    public void checkBalance() {  // Extra method (not in Payment)
        System.out.println("Checking Credit Card balance...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Payment p = new CreditCard();  
        p.pay();  // ✅ Works: "Paying with Credit Card..."
        
        // p.checkBalance();  // ❌ ERROR! Because 'checkBalance' is not in Payment
    }
}
