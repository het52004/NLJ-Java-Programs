1. abstract class cannot be instantiated

2. but it can be inherited

3. why abstract class? consider a class person in college point of view, it has no meaning, it just contains name and age, while consider class student and teacher, both has meanings, and both also has similar attributes, so insted of declaring them in both student and teacher we can declare them in an abstract class, in a college nobody is person, either they are student or they are teacher, so there is no point of creating an object of a person class.

4. it acts same as normal class, it also has constructor and rules are same!
